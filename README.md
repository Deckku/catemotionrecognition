🎯 Overview
Cat Companion is an innovative machine learning project that combines computer vision and audio processing to analyze cat behavior and health in real-time. The system uses three specialized models to provide comprehensive insights into your cat's well-being:

Emotion Recognition from Images - Analyzes facial expressions and body language
Audio Mood Detection - Processes vocalizations like meows and purrs
Health Status Assessment - Identifies potential health issues from visual cues
✨ Features
🖼️ Image Analysis
Emotion Detection: Identifies 11 different emotional states including happy, sad, angry, playful, curious, and more
Health Assessment: Determines if your cat appears healthy or may need veterinary attention
High Accuracy: Trained on thousands of cat images for reliable predictions
🎵 Audio Analysis
Vocalization Classification: Recognizes 10 types of cat sounds including angry, happy, hunting mind, mother call, and warning sounds
Real-time Processing: Analyzes audio from uploaded files or video soundtracks
Emotional Context: Provides insights into what your cat is trying to communicate
🎬 Video Processing
Combined Analysis: Processes both visual and audio components of video files
Frame-by-frame Processing: Extracts key frames for comprehensive analysis
Temporal Tracking: Monitors changes in mood and health over time
💻 User-Friendly Interface
Desktop Application: Built with Tkinter for easy installation and use
Drag & Drop Support: Simple file upload for images, videos, and audio files
Instant Results: Real-time analysis with friendly, actionable feedback
Multi-format Support: Accepts PNG, JPG, MP4, AVI, MOV, WAV, and MP3 files
📊 Dataset
Image Dataset
Emotion Recognition: Curated dataset with 11 emotion categories
Health Assessment: Binary classification dataset (healthy vs. sick)
Quality Control: High-resolution images with clear cat features
Audio Dataset
Size: 5,938 audio files across 10 classes
Categories: Angry, Defence, Fighting, Happy, HuntingMind, Mating, MotherCall, Paining, Resting, Warning
Format: MP3 files processed into mel-spectrograms
Split: 80% training, 20% validation
🏗️ Model Architecture
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
All three models use CNN architectures optimized for their specific tasks:

Input Processing: Images resized to 128x128 pixels, audio converted to mel-spectrograms
Feature Extraction: Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation
Classification: Dense layers with softmax activation for multi-class prediction
Optimization: Adam optimizer with categorical crossentropy loss
