# CatCompanion Project

## Overview

This project aims to classify the health status of cats into two categories: **sick** and **not sick**. By analyzing various features such as age, breed, medical history, and recent symptoms, the project utilizes machine learning techniques to create a model that can accurately classify whether a cat is healthy or suffering from health issues.

## Objective

The goal is to develop a reliable classification model using machine learning algorithms to predict whether a cat is sick or not based on key health-related features. This classification will assist veterinarians or cat owners in identifying potential health issues early.

## Features

The following features are used to classify the health of a cat:

1. **Age**: The age of the cat (numeric).
2. **Breed**: The breed of the cat (categorical).
3. **Medical History**: Previous health conditions or chronic illnesses (binary: `Yes` or `No`).
4. **Recent Symptoms**:
   - Vomiting (binary: `Yes` or `No`)
   - Lethargy (binary: `Yes` or `No`)
   - Loss of appetite (binary: `Yes` or `No`)
   - Diarrhea (binary: `Yes` or `No`)
   - Coughing/Sneezing (binary: `Yes` or `No`)
5. **Vaccination Status**: Whether the cat is up-to-date with vaccinations (binary: `Yes` or `No`).
6. **Current Medications**: Whether the cat is currently on any medication (binary: `Yes` or `No`).
7. **Weight**: The cat’s weight (numeric, in kilograms or pounds).
8. **Activity Level**: Whether the cat is more or less active than usual (binary: `More active` or `Less active`).
9. **Behavioral Changes**: Any recent behavioral changes (binary: `Yes` or `No`).
10. **Hydration Status**: Whether the cat is drinking water as usual (binary: `Yes` or `No`).
11. **Temperature**: The cat’s body temperature (numeric).
12. **Gender**: The cat’s gender (binary: `Male` or `Female`).
13. **Neutered/Spayed**: Whether the cat is neutered or spayed (binary: `Yes` or `No`).
14. **Contact with Other Animals**: Whether the cat has had exposure to other animals that might be sick (binary: `Yes` or `No`).
15. **Health Evaluation**: A general health evaluation from a vet (binary: `Healthy` or `Unhealthy`).
16. **Living Environment**: Whether the cat is kept indoors or outdoors (binary: `Indoor` or `Outdoor`).
